## How to use _Order Me This_

1. When first arriving to our site, new users will be prompted to Sign Up and Sign in to create an account for creating orders. 

2. Once signed in, the user is directed to the Home page and greeted with a welcome message. An order form is providedto create an event and invite others to participate via email.

3. The newly created event is then added to the user's saved list of events.

4. Once participants receive the invitation, they will be directed to the Order page for the specified event to check out a link to the menu or business, and fill out their item(s) of choice, price, and special requests.

5. Once the time alloted for orders to be added comes to a close, the user is able to print out the details and finalize purchases. (This feature is currently a work in progress.)
